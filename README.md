# Factoid-Algorithm-Project

## Overview

Hi there! üëã

This is a C# project we created for **LaSalle College**. The goal is to process text provided by the user and answer questions based on a specific template. Factoid questions are closed-ended questions that start with words like "Who," "When," "Where," "How many," or "How much."

## What You‚Äôll Find

- üìÑ **Docs and Guidelines**: Everything you need to understand the project is in the [docs](docs/) folder.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **A Unique Challenge**: We weren‚Äôt allowed to use certain built-in functions or data structures, so you might spot some extra steps in the code. We got creative to work around those limitations and made it all come together!

## Setup

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shayandelbari/factoid-project.git
    cd factoid-project
    ```

2. Run the project:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can interact with the program by asking factoid questions or using the following keywords:

- **Update**: Changes the reference text.
- **Explain**: Provides a short explanation of the types of questions you can ask.
- **Exit**: Ends the program.
