# How to set up 

run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shayandelbari/factoid-project.git
cd factoid-project
```
then
```bash
dotnet run
```
(or how ever else you run the project in Visual Studio Code)

> You shouldn't need to change any files other than ```Program.cs``` and ```README.md```. If anything else showed up in your "git tree" DON"T COMMIT IT.

Also it's a good idea to run ```git pull``` before you start editing files to get the latest changes.

# How to commit
### Command line interface (CLI)
run
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "A discripteave message to discribe this commit"
git push
```
(You may be asked to input you name and email when you're trying to commit)
