# Tutorial

## Setting up

run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shayandelbari/factoid-project.git
cd factoid-project
dotnet run
```

or how ever else you run the project in Visual Studio Code

> You shouldn't need to change any files other than `Program.cs` and `README.md`. If anything else showed up in your "git tree" DON"T COMMIT IT.

Also it's a good idea to run `git pull` before you start editing files to get the latest changes.

## Commiting

### Command line interface (CLI)

run

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "A descriptive message to describe this commit"
git push
```

(You may be asked to input you name and email when you're trying to commit)

### Visual Studio Code
